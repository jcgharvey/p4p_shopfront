p4p_shopfront
=============
This is the mock shop front for Receipts++

It is used to simulate a PoS Terminal.

The user can choose some 'purchases' and then move to the checkout.

Once in checkout the app can receive NDEF messages via Android Beam, or tap a smart card to the device to the smart card ID.

The receipt is then uploaded to the users receipts++ account.
